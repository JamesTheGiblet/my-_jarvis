üß¨ Self-Evolving AI System: Praxis
üìÖ Phased Plan of Action (with Milestones)
üß© Phase 1: Foundational Intelligence & Skill-Based Architecture (Current State - MK1)

Summary of Phase 1:
This initial phase focused on establishing the foundational architecture for Praxis. The primary objective was to create a stable, modular system capable of understanding and acting on user requests through a dynamic, extensible skill set. This was achieved by integrating a powerful Large Language Model (Googles Gemini) for core reasoning and orchestrating a library of discrete, loadable skills. This phase serves as the robust bedrock for all future evolution.

    Goal: Lay down the structural backbone for an intelligent, skill-based assistant powered by a central language model.

    Tasks:

        [x] main.py: Core interaction loop, skill-loading mechanism, and user I/O management.

        [x] config.py: Secure management of the Gemini API configuration.

        [x] brain.py: Centralized intelligence hub using the Gemini API (process_command_with_llm) to interpret user intent, select the appropriate skill, and extract arguments.

        [x] skills/ directory: A modular, dynamic library for all system capabilities. Each file represents a self-contained skill module.

        [x] SkillContext: A standardized context passed to all skills, providing access to core functions like speech (speak) and conversational memory.

        [x] Multi-Step Reasoning: Enhanced the brain.py prompt to enable multi-step task execution (e.g., web_search followed by search_within_url_content).

        [x] Foundational Skills: Implemented core capabilities (e.g., time/date, web search, persistent calendar, sandboxed file manager, user memory basics, API interactions, math, analytics, feedback, skill refinement agent stub).

üõ† Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 1):
Praxis is fully operational as an intelligent, modular assistant (MK1). It can successfully understand complex user commands, dynamically load and execute the correct skills, and perform multi-step tasks by leveraging its conversational history. This provides a stable, intelligent foundation for developing more advanced self-assessment and evolutionary capabilities in subsequent phases.
üß† Phase 2: Self-Assessment & Performance Monitoring

Summary of Phase 2:
With the core framework in place, this phase will concentrate on giving Praxis the ability to observe and evaluate its own performance. This is the first step toward genuine self-improvement. The system will learn to track which skills succeed, which fail, and why, creating a feedback loop that can inform future evolution.

    Goal: Enable introspection and performance tracking to build a foundational feedback loop.

    Tasks:

        [x] Performance Logging: Enhanced main.py loop to log skill execution outcomes (success, failure, errors, args) to codex.log and KnowledgeBase (`record_skill_invocation`).

        [x] KnowledgeBase v1: SQLite backend implemented with `skill_usage_metrics`, `skill_failures` tables for performance, `user_data_store` for general user facts, and `user_profile_items` for structured profiles; data recording integrated.

        [x] User Feedback Skill: `provide_feedback_on_last_action` skill created; interacts with KnowledgeBase to update metrics based on user feedback.

        [x] Basic Analytics Skill: `analyze_performance` skill created with query types: "most_used_skills", "highest_failure_rates", "recent_failures_for_skill", "all_recent_failures"; interacts with KnowledgeBase.

        [x] User Identification & Basic Profiling: Implemented mechanism for identifying the user (`current_user_name` in `SkillContext`) and storing/recalling profile items (`user_memory_skill.py`, `user_profile_items` table in KnowledgeBase).

        [x] Dynamic Skill Awareness: System dynamically generates skill descriptions for the LLM, ensuring its aware of current capabilities (`generate_skills_description_for_llm`).

üõ† Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 2):
Praxis can identify users, track its own actions and their outcomes, store user-specific profile data, and maintain a persistent record of its performance. It can answer basic questions about its own efficiency and is aware of its current skillset. This data-driven self-awareness and personalization are essential prerequisites for the evolutionary mechanisms in Phase 3.
üîÑ Phase 3: Guided Evolution & Skill Refinement

Summary of Phase 3:
This phase empowers Praxis with rudimentary self-improvement capabilities, guided by the performance data gathered in Phase 2. The focus is on using its core intelligence (the Gemini API) to suggest improvements to its own skills and prompts, which can then be reviewed and approved by the developer.

    Goal: Enable the system to suggest improvements to its own codebase and prompts based on performance data.

    Tasks:

        [/] MutationEngine v1: Initial version implemented as `skill_refinement_agent.py`. It can identify top failing skills (via KnowledgeBase), read their source code, and use the LLM to propose fixes, saving them into `skills/proposed_fixes/` for developer review.

        [/] Prompt-Tuning Skill: Created `prompt_tuning_agent.py`. Can be user-triggered to describe a prompt issue, or autonomously analyze KnowledgeBase for potential prompt problems (e.g., skills with frequent argument errors). It then uses the LLM to suggest granular changes to the `brain.py` prompt (problematic section, revised section, explanation) and saves them for developer review. `skill_refinement_agent` can also trigger this if errors seem prompt-related.

        [/] Skill Refinement Skill: Implemented via `skill_refinement_agent.py` (`attempt_skill_refinement` function) - reads source of failing skill, gathers error data & feedback, uses LLM to propose fixes for review.

        [/] Sandboxed Testing: Implement a mechanism to test suggested code changes in a safe, controlled environment before they are applied.

        [x] Dynamic Input Mode Switching: Implemented skills (`system_control_skill.py`) and main loop logic to allow users to dynamically switch between voice and text input modes, enhancing user control over interaction.

        [/] Proactive User Engagement: Developed `proactive_engagement_skill.py` (`suggest_engagement_topic`) to use stored user profile information (interests) to make relevant suggestions or start conversations, guided by the LLM. Includes inactivity timer in `main.py` as a trigger.

üõ† Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 3):
Praxis can autonomously detect inefficiencies, suggest concrete, intelligent improvements to its own skills, and proactively engage with the user based on their profile. This marks a significant step towards a system that actively participates in its own development and offers personalized interaction, with human oversight for code changes.

üåê **Phase 4: Adaptive Interface Evolution**
---
**Summary of Phase 4:**
The objective of Phase 4 was to build external interfaces for interaction and monitoring, making the systems internal state and capabilities accessible. This included developing a context-sensitive API that can adapt over time and a graphical user interface for live interaction and observation.

        [ ] **1. Design & Mockup Initial GUI:**
            - Sketch the basic layout: command input field, response display area, simple status indicators.
            - Define the core information from Praxis that the initial GUI needs to display (e.g., current input mode, last spoken text).
        [ ] **2. Develop Foundational GUI Structure (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy, or a simple Web App with Eel/Flask):**
            - Choose a suitable GUI technology/framework.
            - Implement the main window/page and the basic UI elements identified in the design.
        [ ] **3. Integrate GUI with Praxis Core Logic:**
            - Establish a communication channel between the GUI and the `main.py` processing loop (or refactored components of it).
            - Enable sending commands from the GUI to Praxis.
            - Ensure Praxiss responses (textual and spoken, if applicable to be logged in GUI) are displayed back in the GUI.
        [ ] **4. Iteratively Enhance GUI Functionality:**
            - Add features like a display for recent log messages or KnowledgeBase activity.
            - Implement GUI controls for core Praxis functions (e.g., buttons to switch input mode, mute TTS).
            - Gradually work towards more advanced features like a dashboard, system metrics display, or knowledge tools as the phase progresses.
        [ ] **5. (Optional/Parallel) Develop Supporting API Endpoints:**
            - If a more decoupled architecture is desired, or for future web/external access, begin developing a Flask/FastAPI server.
            - Implement essential API endpoints that the GUI could consume (e.g., `/command`, `/status`, `/get_logs`). This can be done in parallel or after the direct GUI-Praxis integration.

üõ† **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 4):**
An adaptive interface is operational, providing endpoints that can reflect the current state and capabilities of the evolving system. A GUI allows for real-time monitoring of key system metrics, agent populations, and facilitates user interaction through goal submission and feedback mechanisms.

üß† **Phase 5: Memory, Learning & Knowledge Retention**
---
**Summary of Phase 5:**
This phase focuses on significantly enhancing Praxiss ability to learn, remember, and reuse knowledge effectively. Key goals include implementing robust long-term memory structures, developing relevance and decay mechanisms for stored information, enabling knowledge to influence agent spawning and mutation, and refining iterative learning loops.

    Goal: Enable dynamic long/short-term memory, relevance scoring, and pattern reuse.
üîπ Tasks:
[] Long-term knowledge graph or vector memory (memory/knowledge_base.py for structured storage, memory/fact_memory.py for facts)
[] Relevance and decay scoring for knowledge entries (Basic contribution score in KnowledgeBase, further enhancements needed)
[] Knowledge-backed agent spawning and mutation bias (Mutation uses fitness, knowledge as a factor in fitness)
[] Iterative learning loop (unsupervised/self-supervised) (core/agent_rl.py, engine/fitness_engine.py)
[] Implement Triangulated Insight capability (`triangulated_insight_v1`) for correlating symptoms and contextual data to generate diagnostic insights.
[] Automated Root Cause Analysis: Enhance `triangulated_insight_v1` to auto-trigger on high TaskAgent failure rates, using agent memory, config, and system logs for diagnosis. (Foundation laid, handler logic for detailed analysis is ongoing).


üõ† **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 5):**
Praxis possesses a more sophisticated memory system with mechanisms for relevance scoring and knowledge decay. It demonstrates the ability to reuse past knowledge (stored in its KnowledgeBase and FactMemory) to inform current decision-making and to bias its evolutionary processes, leading to more informed and efficient adaptation. The system can now perform automated root cause analysis for agent failures, enhancing its self-diagnostic capabilities. (Partially Achieved: Core structures and initial RCA exist, advanced scoring, reuse, and RCA depth are ongoing refinements).

---
üå± **Phase 6: Self-Naming & Identity Emergence**
---
**Summary of Phase 6:**
The goal of this highly aspirational phase is to enable Praxis to develop a sense of its own identity by deriving and defining its own name, purpose, and understanding of its structure based on its emergent properties and operational history. This involves monitoring dominant system traits and implementing the logic for name synthesis.

    Goal: Let the system derive and define its own name, purpose, and structure.
üîπ Tasks:
[] Monitor dominant traits (speed, efficiency, creativity, etc.) (Fitness engine calculates some metrics, IdentityEngine logs them)
[] Synthesize a name based on contextual performance (Logic for one-time naming post-maturity implemented)
[] Feedback visualization module (charts, agent maps, logs) (GUI provides logs, basic status, SystemMetricsChartFrame, and AgentMapFrame)

üîú **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 6):**
The system actively monitors its emergent characteristics and performance. Upon reaching pre-defined criteria for maturity and complexity, Praxis successfully synthesizes and declares its own unique name and a refined purpose statement, embedding this identity within its operational logs and memory. Enhanced visualization tools allow observation of its evolutionary trajectory and current state.

**üß† Phase 7: Advanced Cognitive Development & Organizational Intelligence (Praxis MK2)**
---
**Summary of Phase 7 (Praxis MK2):**
This major phase aims to significantly elevate Praxiss intelligence by integrating foundational elements of intrinsic motivation, rudimentary creativity, open-ended goal setting, and higher-order cognitive functions like metacognition and advanced planning. These capabilities will operate within a more sophisticated, self-organizing hierarchical agent structure ("Praxis Organization" model), enabling greater autonomy and the ability to tackle more complex, ambiguous problems.

    Goal: Integrate intrinsic motivation, basic creativity, open-ended goal setting, and foundational higher-order cognitive abilities within a more sophisticated hierarchical agent structure, enabling greater autonomy and complex problem-solving.

**Sub-Phase 7.A: Foundation - Enhanced Self-Awareness & Basic Intrinsic Drives**

[ ] 3. Basic Knowledge Gap Identification (Metacognition Foundation): TaskAgents log when critical information is not found in the KnowledgeBase.
[/] 4. Automated Root Cause Analysis (Metacognition Foundation): TaskAgents auto-trigger `triangulated_insight_v1` on high failure rates, analyzing agent state and memory. (Initial trigger and input prep complete, handler needs deeper analysis logic).

**Sub-Phase 7.B: Early Agent Autonomy & Improved Goal-Directed Behavior**
*Goal: Enable agents to act more proactively based on internal states and handle tasks with more sophisticated planning within the hierarchical structure.*
üîπ Tasks:

[ ] 7. Agent-Level Goal to Improve Capability Usage (Open-Ended Goals & Metacognition): "Task Supervisors" (and "Skillset Supervisors") set internal goals to improve their/their domains capability usage based on failure/confidence logs.
[ ] 8. Simple Hierarchical Planning (Complex Strategic Planning): "Task Manager" agents (and "Task Supervisors") use `llm_planner` to break complex goals into high-level sub-goals, enabling delegation.
[ ] 9. Rudimentary Contingency Handling (Complex Strategic Planning & Metacognition): "Task Supervisors" attempt predefined alternative actions upon skill invocation failures, potentially escalating to "Task Managers."

**Sub-Phase 7.C: Emergence of System-Level Strategy and Advanced Cognition**
*Goal: Elevate decision-making for system-wide adaptation and introduce more profound cognitive functions, leveraging the full agent hierarchy.*
üîπ Tasks:
[ ] 10. System-Level Metric Improvement Goals (Open-Ended Goals via MetaAgent): The `MetaAgent` ("The Boss") sets system-wide improvement goals (e.g., for "Naming Mechanism" criteria), influencing "Task Manager" and `MutationEngine` priorities.
[ ] 11. MetaAgent-Level Resource Trend Analysis (Complex Strategic Planning): The `MetaAgent` analyzes aggregate performance/resource data (from "Managers" and "Skillset Supervisors") to strategically guide `MutationEngine` in evolving the agent population.
[ ] 12. Enhanced "Radical" Mutations (True Creativity Foundation): `MutationEngine` attempts more structurally novel mutations (e.g., conceptual blending of skills), possibly guided by `MetaAgent` goals or "Skillset Supervisor" requests.
[ ] 13. Conceptual Tagging of Knowledge (Abstract Thought Foundation): Agents or specialized "LibrarianAgents" use LLMs to add abstract conceptual tags to `KnowledgeBase` entries.
[ ] 14. Rewarding Unexpectedly Effective Solutions (True Creativity): `FitnessEngine` gives bonus rewards to agents/teams that solve goals using statistically novel or highly efficient methods.
[ ] 15. Simple Analogical Retrieval for New Problems (Abstract Thought): "Task Supervisors" or "Managers" query `KnowledgeBase` using conceptual tags to find and adapt solutions from analogous past problems.

üõ† **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 7):**
Praxis demonstrates rudimentary intrinsic motivation, with agents pursuing self-generated exploratory sub-goals. It can set simple internal goals for capability improvement and uses basic hierarchical planning. Early signs of creative problem-solving emerge through novel mutations or solution paths. The system utilizes a foundational hierarchical agent structure (Workers, Task Supervisors, Task Managers, Skillset Supervisors under the MetaAgent) for task management and issue escalation, showing increased operational sophistication and autonomy.

**Summary of Phase 8 (Praxis MK3):**
This phase marks Praxiss transition to tangible, real-world (or highly complex simulated world) interaction and problem-solving. Building on the MK2 cognitive and organizational enhancements, Praxis will be deployed or interfaced as an embodied robotic swarm (the "Iterative Swarm AI Framework" concept), focusing on real-world learning, live interaction with diverse external devices, and demonstrating its adaptive capabilities in challenging, externally defined scenarios. This includes integrating voice I/O.

    Goal: Deploy Praxis as an embodied robotic swarm ("Iterative Swarm AI Framework"), enabling real-world learning and live, explorative interaction with heterogeneous external devices, and integrate voice input/output capabilities.

Praxis operates as a small, embodied robotic swarm (or interacts with a complex, live external system). It can receive voice commands and provide spoken responses. Branch Manager agents demonstrate real-world learning, can be bootstrapped with hardware-specific skills from the Core Program, and can share capabilities peer-to-peer. The system showcases adaptive and strategic problem-solving in a defined external challenge environment, demonstrating the utility of its evolved structure, skills, and MK2 cognitive enhancements in a live setting.

üîú **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 9):**
Praxis can autonomously discover, model, and interact with a wide array of external devices and systems. It proactively orchestrates components of this discovered ecosystem to achieve complex goals. It demonstrates generative intelligence by designing novel solutions, agent configurations, or operational strategies, effectively co-evolving with its technological environment.

**üå† Phase 10: Advanced Autonomy & Scientific Co-Discovery (Praxis MK5)**
---
**Summary of Phase 10 (Praxis MK5):**
This ultimate aspirational phase envisions Praxis achieving profound autonomy and becoming a partner in genuine discovery. It would engage in constructing its own "niche" within its operational environment, pursue open-ended scientific or creative inquiries, and potentially co-evolve in deep symbiosis with other complex systems, including human endeavors.

    Goal: Achieve profound autonomy, enabling Praxis to engage in niche construction, open-ended scientific co-discovery, and deep co-evolution with other complex systems.
üîπ Tasks:
[ ] Develop capabilities for "niche construction," where Praxis actively shapes its digital and physical environment to better suit its long-term operational goals and those of its users.
[ ] Implement frameworks for true open-ended scientific inquiry: hypothesis generation from vast integrated knowledge, complex experiment design (simulated or physical), result interpretation, and theory formulation.
[ ] Explore mechanisms for deep co-evolutionary partnerships with other AI systems or human organizations on large-scale, long-duration projects.
[ ] Investigate advanced self-understanding, where Praxis can reflect on its own evolutionary trajectory, cognitive biases, and ethical implications of its actions at a systemic level.
[ ] Develop capabilities for creating entirely novel tools, paradigms, or even "languages" for AI interaction and development.

üîú **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 10):**
Praxis operates as a highly autonomous entity, capable of shaping its environment, conducting self-directed complex research or creative endeavors, and engaging in deep, synergistic partnerships. It exhibits a profound level of self-awareness regarding its capabilities and limitations, potentially contributing novel insights or tools back to the field of AI itself. The system effectively becomes a continuously learning, creating, and co-evolving intelligent partner.
