🧬 Self-Evolving AI System: Praxis
📅 Phased Plan of Action (with Milestones)
🧩 Phase 1: Foundational Intelligence & Skill-Based Architecture (Current State - MK1)

Summary of Phase 1:
This initial phase focused on establishing the foundational architecture for Praxis. The primary objective was to create a stable, modular system capable of understanding and acting on user requests through a dynamic, extensible skill set. This was achieved by integrating a powerful Large Language Model (Googles Gemini) for core reasoning and orchestrating a library of discrete, loadable skills. This phase serves as the robust bedrock for all future evolution.

    Goal: Lay down the structural backbone for an intelligent, skill-based assistant powered by a central language model.

    Tasks:

        [x] main.py: Core interaction loop, skill-loading mechanism, and user I/O management.

        [x] config.py: Secure management of the Gemini API configuration.

        [x] brain.py: Centralized intelligence hub using the Gemini API (process_command_with_llm) to interpret user intent, select the appropriate skill, and extract arguments.

        [x] skills/ directory: A modular, dynamic library for all system capabilities. Each file represents a self-contained skill module.

        [x] SkillContext: A standardized context passed to all skills, providing access to core functions like speech (speak) and conversational memory.

        [x] Multi-Step Reasoning: Enhanced the brain.py prompt to enable multi-step task execution (e.g., web_search followed by search_within_url_content).

        [x] Foundational Skills: Implemented core capabilities (e.g., time/date, web search, persistent calendar, sandboxed file manager, user memory basics, API interactions, math, analytics, feedback, skill refinement agent stub, news fetching via feedparser).

🛠 Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 1):
Praxis is fully operational as an intelligent, modular assistant (MK1). It can successfully understand complex user commands, dynamically load and execute the correct skills, and perform multi-step tasks by leveraging its conversational history. This provides a stable, intelligent foundation for developing more advanced self-assessment and evolutionary capabilities in subsequent phases.
🧠 Phase 2: Self-Assessment & Performance Monitoring

Summary of Phase 2:
With the core framework in place, this phase will concentrate on giving Praxis the ability to observe and evaluate its own performance. This is the first step toward genuine self-improvement. The system will learn to track which skills succeed, which fail, and why, creating a feedback loop that can inform future evolution.

    Goal: Enable introspection and performance tracking to build a foundational feedback loop.
    Goal: Directly enhance Core Intelligence (CIQ) and Emotional Aptitude (CEQ) through targeted feature development.

    Tasks:

        [x] Performance Logging: Enhanced main.py loop to log skill execution outcomes (success, failure, errors, args) to codex.log and KnowledgeBase (`record_skill_invocation`).

        [x] KnowledgeBase v1: SQLite backend implemented with `skill_usage_metrics`, `skill_failures` tables for performance, `user_data_store` for general user facts, and `user_profile_items` for structured profiles; data recording integrated.

        [/] User Feedback Skill: Foundational `record_user_feedback` in KnowledgeBase exists. Primary feedback mechanism now UI-driven (Phase 3) logging to `interaction_feedback` table.

        [x] Basic Analytics Skill: `analyze_performance` skill created with query types: "most_used_skills", "highest_failure_rates", "recent_failures_for_skill", "all_recent_failures"; interacts with KnowledgeBase.

        [x] User Identification & Basic Profiling: Implemented mechanism for identifying the user (`current_user_name` in `SkillContext`) and storing/recalling profile items (`user_memory_skill.py`, `user_profile_items` table in KnowledgeBase).

        [x] Dynamic Skill Awareness: System dynamically generates skill descriptions for the LLM, ensuring its aware of current capabilities (`generate_skills_description_for_llm`).

    Tasks for CIQ/CEQ Enhancement:
        [x] CIQ - "Test & Repair" Loop: Implemented a loop where unit test failures for LLM-generated code are fed back to the LLM with the original prompt, faulty code, and error for correction. (brain.py, evaluate_ciq.py)
        [x] CIQ - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - Initial Placeholder: Added a placeholder in `brain.py` to retrieve and inject relevant context (e.g., from codebase, API docs, style guides) into the code generation prompt, improving domain-specific knowledge.
        [x] CEQ - Intent-Aware Prompt Engineering: Implemented a pre-processing step in `main.py` and `brain.py` to modify the system prompt based on sentiment analysis of user input, tailoring the AIs persona for more empathetic responses.
        [x] CEQ - Structured Output for State Awareness: Enhanced brain.py to prompt the LLM for JSON output that includes CEQ metadata like explanation, confidence_score, and warnings, making the AIs state more transparent and programmatically accessible.

🛠 Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 2):
Praxis can identify users, track its own actions and their outcomes, store user-specific profile data, and maintain a persistent record of its performance. It can answer basic questions about its own efficiency and is aware of its current skillset. Targeted CIQ/CEQ enhancements are in place. This data-driven self-awareness, personalization, and enhanced core AI capabilities are essential prerequisites for the evolutionary mechanisms in the next phases.

---
🔄 **Phase 3: The Continuous Feedback Loop**
---
**Summary of Phase 3:**
This phase focuses on establishing robust mechanisms for continuous improvement by integrating automated evaluations and direct user feedback into the development lifecycle. The goal is to ensure that CIQ (Core Intelligence) and CEQ (Core Emotional Aptitude) improve with every iteration.

    Goal: Implement systems for ongoing evaluation and feedback collection to drive continuous AI improvement.

    Tasks:
        [x] **Automate Evaluation:** Integrated the "Evaluation Harness" (`evaluate_ciq.py`, `evaluate_ceq.py`) into a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The workflow automatically runs evaluations on pushes/PRs, generates reports, and compares current CIQ scores against previous runs to track regressions or improvements. (Process Task - GitHub Actions workflow defined)
        [x] **Collect User Feedback (UI):** Added thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons in the GUI for users to provide feedback on AI responses. (`gui.py`)
        [x] **Collect User Feedback (Backend):** Implemented backend logic in `main.py` (PraxisCore) to receive UI feedback and store it.
        [x] **Data for Fine-Tuning (Logging):** Enhanced `knowledge_base.py` to log detailed interaction data, including user feedback. Positively reviewed interactions are flagged as "High-CEQ examples," and successful code generations from the CIQ harness serve as "High-CIQ examples," creating a dataset for future LLM fine-tuning.

        [x] **Evolve Evaluation Harnesses for Advanced Capabilities:**
            - Concept: As more complex skills are developed (e.g., for creativity, strategic planning, advanced data analysis, or nuanced emotional understanding in later phases), continuously adapt and expand the CIQ and CEQ evaluation harnesses. This may involve designing entirely new benchmarks, metrics, or qualitative assessment frameworks to measure these more abstract capabilities.
            - Value: Ensures that Praxiss most advanced cognitive functions can be rigorously and relevantly tested and improved, maintaining a high standard of quality and reliability as its intelligence deepens. This supports the goal of CIQ/CEQ improving with every iteration, even as the definition of "intelligence" for Praxis expands.

🛠 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 3):**
Praxis has an integrated feedback system allowing users to rate AI responses. All interactions and feedback are logged, creating a rich dataset for future fine-tuning. Automated CIQ/CEQ evaluation is set up in the development pipeline, providing constant visibility into AI performance changes.

🔄 Phase 4: Guided Evolution & Skill Refinement (Previously Phase 3)

Summary of Phase 4:
This phase empowers Praxis with rudimentary self-improvement capabilities, guided by the performance data gathered in Phase 2. The focus is on using its core intelligence (the Gemini API) to suggest improvements to its own skills and prompts, which can then be reviewed and approved by the developer.

    Goal: Enable the system to suggest improvements to its own codebase and prompts based on performance data.

    Tasks:

        [/] MutationEngine v1: Initial version implemented as `skill_refinement_agent.py`. It can identify top failing skills (via KnowledgeBase), read their source code, and use the LLM to propose fixes, saving them into `skills/proposed_fixes/` for developer review.

        [/] Prompt-Tuning Skill: Created `prompt_tuning_agent.py`. Can be user-triggered to describe a prompt issue, or autonomously analyze KnowledgeBase for potential prompt problems (e.g., skills with frequent argument errors). It then uses the LLM to suggest granular changes to the `brain.py` prompt (problematic section, revised section, explanation) and saves them for developer review. `skill_refinement_agent` can also trigger this if errors seem prompt-related.

        [/] Skill Refinement Skill: Implemented via `skill_refinement_agent.py` (`attempt_skill_refinement` function) - reads source of failing skill, gathers error data & feedback, uses LLM to propose fixes for review.

        [/] Sandboxed Testing: Implement a mechanism to test suggested code changes in a safe, controlled environment before they are applied.

        [x] Dynamic Input Mode Switching: Implemented in `main.py` and `brain.py` to allow users to dynamically switch between voice and text input modes, enhancing user control over interaction.

        [/] Proactive User Engagement: Developed `proactive_engagement_skill.py` (`suggest_engagement_topic`) to use stored user profile information (interests) to make relevant suggestions or start conversations, guided by the LLM. Includes inactivity timer in `main.py` as a trigger.

update  [ ] **Reinforce Feedback Loop for Skill Refinement:**
            - Concept: Enhance `skill_refinement_agent.py` to more deeply integrate and prioritize both direct user feedback (from `interaction_feedback` table in `knowledge_base.py`) and automated performance data (`skill_failures`, `skill_usage_metrics`) as core inputs for identifying, prioritizing, and guiding the refinement of skills.
            - Value: Accelerates the evolutionary process by ensuring that skill improvements are directly driven by observed shortcomings and user experiences, making the system more responsive and effective over time.

update  [ ] **Deeper User Understanding & Personalization:**
            - [ ] **Communication Style Adapter Skill:**
                - Concept: Analyzes user language (formality, verbosity, slang/emoji use) over time from `interaction_feedback` and `user_input` logs.
                - Value: Allows Praxis to tune its own response style (e.g., conciseness, descriptiveness, tone) to match the users preference, leading to more natural interactions. This would likely involve dynamic adjustments to the persona/instructional part of prompts sent to the LLM.
            - [ ] **Implicit Goal Inference Skill:**
                - Concept: Analyzes patterns in user command history (from `skill_usage_metrics` and `interaction_feedback` in `knowledge_base.py`) to identify recurring sequences of actions or unstated, larger goals.
                - Value: Enables Praxis to proactively suggest helpful actions, new combined skills, or automations. For example, "Ive noticed you often X then Y. Would you like a skill to do both?"

update  [ ] **Broader World Interaction & Knowledge Acquisition:**
            - [ ] **Web Scraper & Information Synthesizer Skill:**
                - Concept: Can take a URL, scrape text content (respecting `robots.txt`), and use the LLM to summarize or answer questions based on the content. Requires libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4`.
                - Value: Grants Praxis access to current events, niche topics, and documentation not available via structured APIs, significantly expanding general knowledge.
            - [ ] **RSS Feed & News Monitoring Skill:**
                - Concept: Advanced news fetching. User tasks Praxis to monitor specific RSS feeds/news sources for keywords/topics. Praxis summarizes or alerts on new relevant items. (Enhances current `feedparser` usage).
                - Value: Boosts proactive engagement by providing timely, personalized updates on topics of interest to the user, making Praxis a more active information curator.

🛠 Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 4):
Praxis can autonomously detect inefficiencies, suggest concrete, intelligent improvements to its own skills, and proactively engage with the user based on their profile. This marks a significant step towards a system that actively participates in its own development and offers personalized interaction, with human oversight for code changes.

🌐 **Phase 5: Adaptive Interface Evolution (Previously Phase 4)**
---
**Summary of Phase 5:**
The objective of Phase 4 was to build external interfaces for interaction and monitoring, making the systems internal state and capabilities accessible. This included developing a context-sensitive API that can adapt over time and a graphical user interface for live interaction and observation.

        [x] **1. Design & Mockup Initial GUI:**
            - Sketch the basic layout: command input field, response display area, simple status indicators.
            - Define the core information from Praxis that the initial GUI needs to display (e.g., current input mode, last spoken text).
        [x] **2. Develop Foundational GUI Structure (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy, or a simple Web App with Eel/Flask):**
            - Choose a suitable GUI technology/framework.
            - Implement the main window/page and the basic UI elements identified in the design.
        [x] **3. Integrate GUI with Praxis Core Logic:**

            - Enable sending commands from the GUI to Praxis.
            - Ensure Praxiss responses (textual and spoken, if applicable to be logged in GUI) are displayed back in the GUI.
        [/] **4. Iteratively Enhance GUI Functionality:**
            - Add features like a display for recent log messages or KnowledgeBase activity.
            - Implement GUI controls for core Praxis functions (e.g., buttons to switch input mode, mute TTS).
            - Gradually work towards more advanced features like a dashboard, system metrics display, or knowledge tools as the phase progresses.
        [x] **5. (Optional/Parallel) Develop Supporting API Endpoints:**
            - If a more decoupled architecture is desired, or for future web/external access, begin developing a Flask/FastAPI server.
            - Implement essential API endpoints that the GUI could consume (e.g., `/command`, `/status`, `/get_logs`). (FastAPI server with `/command`, `/status`, `/logs` endpoints implemented and tested in `api_server.py`)
🛠 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 5):**
An adaptive interface is operational, providing endpoints that can reflect the current state and capabilities of the evolving system. A GUI allows for real-time monitoring of key system metrics, agent populations, and facilitates user interaction through goal submission and feedback mechanisms.

🧠 **Phase 6: Memory, Learning & Knowledge Retention (Previously Phase 5)**
---
**Summary of Phase 6:**
This phase focuses on significantly enhancing Praxiss ability to learn, remember, and reuse knowledge effectively. Key goals include implementing robust long-term memory structures, developing relevance and decay mechanisms for stored information, enabling knowledge to influence agent spawning and mutation, and refining iterative learning loops.
    **This phase is considered a critical inflection point, as a robust and dynamic memory system is the gateway to true context-awareness, deep personalization, and will serve as the essential foundation for more advanced capabilities in subsequent phases like Embodiment and Generative Intelligence.**
    Goal: Enable dynamic long/short-term memory, relevance scoring, and pattern reuse.
🔹 Tasks:
[] Long-term knowledge graph or vector memory (memory/knowledge_base.py for structured storage, memory/fact_memory.py for facts)
[] Relevance and decay scoring for knowledge entries (Basic contribution score in KnowledgeBase, further enhancements needed)
[] Knowledge-backed agent spawning and mutation bias (Mutation uses fitness, knowledge as a factor in fitness)
[] Iterative learning loop (unsupervised/self-supervised) (core/agent_rl.py, engine/fitness_engine.py)
[] Implement Triangulated Insight capability (`triangulated_insight_v1`) for correlating symptoms and contextual data to generate diagnostic insights.
[] Automated Root Cause Analysis: Enhance `triangulated_insight_v1` to auto-trigger on high TaskAgent failure rates, using agent memory, config, and system logs for diagnosis. (Foundation laid, handler logic for detailed analysis is ongoing).

🛠 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 6):**
Praxis possesses a more sophisticated memory system with mechanisms for relevance scoring and knowledge decay. It demonstrates the ability to reuse past knowledge (stored in its KnowledgeBase and FactMemory) to inform current decision-making and to bias its evolutionary processes, leading to more informed and efficient adaptation. The system can now perform automated root cause analysis for agent failures, enhancing its self-diagnostic capabilities. (Partially Achieved: Core structures and initial RCA exist, advanced scoring, reuse, and RCA depth are ongoing refinements).

---
🌱 **Phase 7: Self-Naming & Identity Emergence (Previously Phase 6)**
---
**Summary of Phase 7:**
The goal of this highly aspirational phase is to enable Praxis to develop a sense of its own identity by deriving and defining its own name, purpose, and understanding of its structure based on its emergent properties and operational history. This involves monitoring dominant system traits and implementing the logic for name synthesis.

    Goal: Let the system derive and define its own name, purpose, and structure. (Foundation for naming exists via skills like `get_self_name` and `choose_and_set_name` if implemented).
🔹 Tasks:
[] Monitor dominant traits (speed, efficiency, creativity, etc.) (Fitness engine calculates some metrics, IdentityEngine logs them)
[] Synthesize a name based on contextual performance (Logic for one-time naming post-maturity implemented)
[] Feedback visualization module (charts, agent maps, logs) (GUI provides logs, basic status, SystemMetricsChartFrame, and AgentMapFrame)

🔜 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 7):**
The system actively monitors its emergent characteristics and performance. Upon reaching pre-defined criteria for maturity and complexity, Praxis successfully synthesizes and declares its own unique name and a refined purpose statement, embedding this identity within its operational logs and memory. Enhanced visualization tools allow observation of its evolutionary trajectory and current state.
